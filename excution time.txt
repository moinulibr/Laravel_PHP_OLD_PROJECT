	$users = App\User::all();



	public function __construct()
	{
    		set_time_limit(8000000);
	}



it's a pure PHP setting. The alternative is to increase the execution time limit only for specific php scripts, by inserting on top of that php file, the following:

ini_set('max_execution_time', 180); //3 minutes
