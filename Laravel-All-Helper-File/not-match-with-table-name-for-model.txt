		if our model name and table name is not equel, then we can set table name and primary key and other in the Model like...

	<?php

	namespace App\Model\User;

	use Illuminate\Notifications\Notifiable;
	use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;

	class User extends Authenticatable
	{
   		 use Notifiable;
		
		protected $table = 'users';
		protected $primaryKey = 'user_id'; //[if its different, not id, then we can set this way] [if laravel default convension is not match]
	}

		[match assaining.]

	-------------------- in this Model--- here is protected $fillable = from where we can set , which field can be filled .. 

	and ----- protected $guarded = []; this is alternative of $fillabe ... which field we cantnot fill , that's fields list  have to set in this $guarded
		
		// $hidden = which field we don't want to show the users site .. that fields we set here [when select table for get data from table]
	 protected $hidden = [
        'password', 'remember_token',
    			];
